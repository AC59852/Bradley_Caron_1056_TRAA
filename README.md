Welcome to the TRAA website! Here you can find any and all information on the TRAA.

Take a look around our newly updated site by our two fantastic web developers!

## Setup

Just clone and go! Nothing special, just clone anywhere on your PC and check out the pages!

## Philosphy

As we reinvented the site, we stuck with a few themes throughout all of the pages.
<br>
**Simple** - The average viewer of this site doesn't want to click through 15 pages to find the one thing they want to see.
<br>
We created a simple homepage with instant access to the about page through our button underneath, and the Nav bar at the top.
<br>
A lack of information on the homepage drives the user to view other pages, giving a more detailed view of what viewers might be looking for.
<br> Every page has a simple theme of: immediate information with minimal effort to find it. Looking for an event from 2 years ago?
<br>
Well just go to Past Events and scroll down slightly. How about the 1986 Newsletter? Again, go to the Newsletter page and scroll down once. Two motions to get everything you need.

**Modern** - Who said you needed to be a fortune 500 company to appear professional?
<br>
A sleek animation revealing the title on the homepage with a gorgeous background eminates professional. 
<br>
Every page contains either the Glacial Indifference, or Open Sans font styles, which are simple, modern and a pleasure to look at.
<br>
Every picture has been touched up ever so slightly to enhance viewing experience and prove that we don't just *take pictures*

**Minimal** - While the TRAA completes complex tasks, the viewing experience doesn't need to be as hard as clearing a tree from a river.
<br>
Every piece of immediately viewable content has been structured to give as much information as needed at a glance, with as little content used as possible. This gives us the opportunity to redirect that user to much more content if they want to view it.

## Tools Used
**Sublime Text** - The text editor of choice for coding and creating the HTML, CSS, and JS
<br>
**Photoshop** - For touching up images, creating our wireframes, and concept ideas
<br>
**Premiere Pro** - For conceptualizing animations and possible transitions

## Authors
**Austin Caron** - Created the animation, transition, HTML shell and JS for carousel
<br>
**Patrick Bradley** - Created the design, wireframes, CSS and chose all content for the site
